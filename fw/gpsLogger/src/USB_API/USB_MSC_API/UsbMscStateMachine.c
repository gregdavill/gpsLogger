//! Checks to see if a SCSI command has been received. If so, it handles it. If not, it returns
//! having taken no action.
//! The return values of this function are intended to be used with entry of low-power modes. If the
//! function returns \b USBMSC_OK_TO_SLEEP, then no further application action is required; that is,
//! either no SCSI command was received; one was received but immediately handled; or one was
//! received but the handling will be completed in the background by the API as it automatically
//! services USB interrupts.
//! If instead the function returns \b USBMSC_PROCESS_BUFFER, then the API is currently servicing a
//! SCSI READ or WRITE command, and the API requires the application to process a buffer. (See
//! Sec. 8.3.6 of \e "Programmer's Guide: MSP430 USB API Stack for CDC/PHDC/HID/MSC" for a discussion of buffer
//! processing.)
//! Note that even if the function returns these values, the values could potentially be outdated by
//! the time the application evaluates them. For this reason, it's important to disable interrupts prior
//! to calling this function. See Sec. 8.3.5 of \e "Programmer's Guide: MSP430 USB API Stack for CDC/PHDC/HID/MSC"
//! for more information.
