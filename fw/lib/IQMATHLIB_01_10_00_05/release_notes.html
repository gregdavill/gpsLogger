<h1>IQmathLib for MSP430 and MSP432 version 01.10.00.05</h1>
<h2>Release Notes&nbsp;</h2>

<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Texas Instruments IQmath and Qmath Libraries are a collection of highly optimized and
high-precision mathematical functions for C programmers to seamlessly port a floating-point algorithm
into fixed-point code on MSP430 and MSP432 devices. These routines are typically used
in computationally intensive real-time applications where optimal execution speed, high accuracy
and ultra low energy are critical. By using the IQmath and Qmath libraries, it is possible to achieve
execution speeds considerably faster and energy consumption considerably lower than equivalent
code written using floating-point math.</p>
<p>The Qmath library provides functions for use with 16-bit fixed point data types. These functions
have been optimized for all devices and can efficiently be used with or without a hardware multiplier.
The functions provide up to 16 bits of accuracy to satisfy the majority of applications on MSP430
devices.</p>
<p>The IQmath library provides the same functions as the Qmath library with 32-bit data types and
higher accuracy. These functions are provided for when an application requires accuracy comparable
or greater than the equivalent floating point math functions.</p>
The following tool chains are officially supported:
<ul>
<li>Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio version 5.5.0 and newer.</li>
<li>IAR Embedded Workbench version 5.60 and newer.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Whats_New" id="Whats_New">What's New</a></h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">01.10.00.05:</span>
<ul>
<li>Added support for ARM Cortex M4 based MSP432 devices.
</ul>

</ul><h2><a name="Revision_History" id="Revision_History"></a>Version History</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">01.00.02.07:</span>
<p>This release addresses several bugs found in previous versions of the
libraries. The type and function names remain unchanged and this release
does not break compatibility with any previous releases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the release notes with introduction, versioning information and support.
<li>Fixed bug ID 7989 which caused a compiler warning due to redefined macro when including both QmathLib.h and IQmathLib.h.
<li>Fixed bug ID 7946 which caused _atoQ and _atoIQ functions to fail when a decimal point is not provided in the input string.
<li>Fixed bug ID 7947 which caused _Qtoa and _IQtoa functions to generate incorrect string characters when the input argument is the minimum signed integer.
<li>Fixed bug ID 8143 which caused _IQdiv functions to fail on certain combinations of input arguments.
<li>Fixed bug ID 8183 which caused an IAR linker error for redefined module when using both QmathLib and IQmathLib libraries.
</ul>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">01.00.01.12:</span>
<ul>
<li>Added support for new code model option in IAR Embedded Workbench for MSP430 version 6.10.
<li>New library directory structure to support all MSP430 devices and models.
<li>New example project (QmathLib_functional_ex3) to demonstrate basic functionality of the libraries.
<li>Removed SFR dependencies for MPY32 peripheral to enable GCC support with libraries built for the TI tool chain (see section 2.4 in the <a href="MSP430-IQmathLib-UsersGuide.pdf">IQmathLib User's Guide</a> for more details).
<li>Changed the license from TI proprietary to BSD.
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">01.00.00.00:</span>
<ul>
<li>Initial release of the IQmathLib for MSP430 devices.
</ul>

</ul><h2><a name="Versioning" id="Versioning"></a>Versioning</h2>
<p>All releases have 4 digits (M.mm.pp.bb). This includes GA and
pre-releases (engineering, alpha/EA, beta, etc.). Pre-releases are
denoted with a suffix (e.g. 6.30.00.00-eng or 6.30.00.10-beta).</p>
<p>This product's version follows a version format, M.mm.pp.bb, where M is
a single digit Major number, mm is 2 digit minor number, pp is a 2
digit patch number, and b is an unrestricted set of digits used as an
incrementing build counter.</p>
<p>To support multiple side-by-side installations of the product, the
product version is encoded in the top level directory (e.g.
IQMATHLIB_01_00_00_00).</p>
<p>Subsequent releases of patch upgrades will be identified by the patch
number, ex. 1.0.1.05 with directory
IQMATHLIB_01_00_01_05. Typically, these patches only
include critical bug fixes.</p>
